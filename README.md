Plotting the Wurstmineberg Minecraft Server

## What this is
Primarily it's me playing around with [R](http://www.r-project.org).  
Besides that, this will be an addition to the [wurstmineberg](http://wurstminebger.de) player statistics page at our [stats page](http://wurstminebger.de/stats). 
The plots relevant to the stats page are in [Plots/statspage](https://github.com/jemus42/wurstminestats/tree/master/Plots/statspage), which will probably be up on the website some time in the near future, when all the plots are done.  
There are also some general more or less informative plots in [Plots](https://github.com/jemus42/wurstminestats/tree/master/Plots).

To make it easier to view the plots while they're being made, the "Plots" directory is also mirrored to our image site at [i.wurstmineberg.de](http://i.wurstmineberg.de/wurstminestats/).

## Contribution
* If you're familiar with R or [ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/), I appreciate any hints on how to do something better, cleaner, more efficient or just more visually pleasing. 
* Requests for graphs are appreciated, and if I figure out how to make them happen, I will
* Visual errors in graphs can be reported via the issue tracker, you know, to keep track
* Errors with the data itself are more or less out of my reach.
