## What this is
Primarily it's me playing around with [R](http://www.r-project.org).  
Besides that, this will be an addition to the [wurstmineberg](http://wurstminebger.de) player statistics page at our [stats page](http://wurstminebger.de/stats). 

Since now `Plots`and `data`are gitignored, the public directoy at [i.wurstmineberg.de/wurstminestats](http://i.wurstmineberg.de/wurstminestats/) is the place to go for up to date data (hopefully). 
For everything else, I'm currently working on a [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) version of wurstminestats, which should serve as a more convenient place to scroll through the data. In the long run, other fancy stuff might happen, but it's all very early as of now.

## Deployment
The plots are now generated by executing `genAll.R`on wurstmineberg.de via the `fcrontab` entry

    30 3,6,18,21 * * * /opt/hub/wurstmineberg/wurstminestats/genAll.R

…which, in theory, should update the plots every 3 hours at 30m past the hour, to reduce load on full hours caused by backup compression and whatnot.  

## Dependencies
Besides a recent version of R (duh), there are some things you need for this to be portable to any other Minecraft server. Let's go over the foreign data sources in this briefly.  

### Data sources
* http://api.wurstmineberg.de/server/playerstats/general.json
* http://api.wurstmineberg.de/server/playerstats/achievement.json
* http://api.wurstmineberg.de/server/playerstats/item.json
* http://api.wurstmineberg.de/server/playerstats/entity.json  

These are [Minecraft API](http://api.wurstmineberg.de) endpoints, which expose the actual player statistics we're interested in visualising. If you have this set up for your own server, you're pretty much good to go. Almost.

### General information sources
* http://wurstmineberg.de/assets/serverstatus/people.json  

This is our people database, which holds metadata about the people on our server, such as join date, nickname (ID), minecraft username and what have you. This is required to sort and classify the datasets. It is required in many dataset transformations, because I substitute minecraft usernames with their nicknames (IDs), sort them by join dates and group by their join status, so… If you don't want to set up a people.json, you'd need to get rid of these parts manually.

* http://wurstmineberg.de/static/json/achievements.json

Just some substitution-friendly strings to make achievements more human readable.  

* http://wurstmineberg.de/static/json/strings.json

Similar to achievements.json, this provides names and classification for player stats, as well as some mob name substitutions.

## Contribution
* If you're familiar with R or [ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/), I appreciate any hints on how to do something better, cleaner, more efficient or just more visually pleasing. 
* Requests for graphs are appreciated, and if I figure out how to make them happen, I will
* Visual errors in graphs can be reported via the issue tracker, you know, to keep track
* Errors with the data itself are more or less out of my reach.
